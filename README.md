# Random_Recipes_Discord_Bot

A discord bot that allows the user to receive a random recipe with a simple prompt in any discord channel in a server that the bot is located.
The bot will need to be hosted via a cloud hosting platform if you want the bot running 24/7.
There are limitations on the bot itself due to the use of the Spoonacular API which only allows around 150 requests per day, this however does keep this bot 100% free.
You will also need to get your own API token for both discord and Spoonacular and then add it to the global variables at the top of the code, without this the bot wont work.
